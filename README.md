# Day-to-Night-

For my final project, I created a day to night simulation featuring inclement weather in Processing Java. I used a stages to move between the different states, and--as mentioned in the code--the states can be toggled using the number keys. In the third state, onClick the leaves will fall off the tree. Be sure to include the two separate tab classes: Drop and Leaf!
